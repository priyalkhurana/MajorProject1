# AUTOMATED WILDLIFE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION

This project aims to develop an automated system for wildlife species classification in forest camera trap images using PyTorch and deep learning techniques. The manual segregation of wildlife images is a time-consuming task, and our goal is to automate this process to assist conservation efforts.
